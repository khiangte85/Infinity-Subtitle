00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EASY JAPANESE is brought to you from Sendai.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today, I'd like to ask people in Sendai what they think about Japan.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hello! Today, I'd like to ask people in Sendai what they think about Japan.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello! Today, I'd like to ask people in Sendai what they think about Japan.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What I think about Japan?

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes! What I think about Japan.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
As for fish, the freshest fish in Japan is around the sea.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's best to catch fresh fish whenever you can.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In Japan, the food is delicious.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What's your favorite food in Japan?

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Rice?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, rice.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I like Japanese food.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're getting a lot of attention for your health.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I like miso soup.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's true.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hello!

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hello.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Today, I'd like to ask people what they think about Japan.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What do you think is good about Japan?

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
There are a lot of women who look good with black hair.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Do you mean women with black hair?

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, I think women with long black hair are the most beautiful.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They are considerate.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's nice.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Do you feel that in your daily life?

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They are kind.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
They are very kind to the elderly.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They have a kind heart.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Considerate.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Considerate.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's a word I'd like to spread abroad.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's right.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The word considerate can be used for anything.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
For example, going to a restaurant and eating without leaving anything behind is considerate.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Taking care of people is considerate.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think the word considerate can be used for anything.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's nice.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's true.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How should I put it?

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Considerate for people.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Considerate for people.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That kind of thing can be put into one word.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
For example, even if it snows, there are about 10 types of snow.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
There is a type of snow called Sasame snow.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There is a type of snow called Awa snow.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't think there are any other countries that have such rich expressions.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What do you think are the good things about Japan?

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Something that comes out of nowhere.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Anime.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I think it's anime.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I can't think of anything.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Anime.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Do you like anime?

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't really like it, but I don't think there are any other countries that have it.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Anime culture.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Otaku culture.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
For example, what kind of anime do you like?

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Dragon Ball.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Doraemon.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, Doraemon.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Dragon Ball.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
By the way, today we are conscious of pre-cure.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Pre-cure.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We are conscious of pre-cure.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Like this.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Haikyuu.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Kuromachi.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The latest anime.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Otake.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What do you think is bad about Japan?

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't like it.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Do you?

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't really like it.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What is it?

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I only look at my cell phone.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Alchism.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The language has been disordered recently.

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
When we were young, the word yabai was a word used by yakuza.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So that has changed.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
For example, irezumi.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Tattoo.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's not different at all.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's a sign of a criminal.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't know what to say.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It was perfect.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Thank you.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Thank you.
